## why preprocessing the text data
Around 90% of the worldâ€™s data is unstructured and may be present in the
form of an image, text, audio, and video. Text can come in a variety of
forms from a list of individual words, to sentences to multiple paragraphs
with special characters (like tweets and other punctuation's). It also may
be present in the form of web, HTML, documents, etc. And this data is never
clean and consists of a lot of noise. It needs to be treated and then perform
a few of the preprocessing functions to make sure we have the right input data
for the feature engineering and model building.

## Preprocessing involves
Transforming raw text data into an understandable format. Real-world data is 
very often incomplete, inconsistent, and filled with a lot of noise and is likely 
to contain many errors.

# Data preprocessing prepares raw text data for further processing.
